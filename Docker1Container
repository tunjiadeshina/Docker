Create a directory called "Docker" using command 
'mkdir Docker'
change into the directory using command
cd Docker
use a file editor to create a file called 'Dockerfile" using command
nano Dockerfile
Edit the file and add the following command
FROM centos
RUN yum -y install httpd
CMD apachectl -DFOREGROUND
(this command downloads centos from docker hub, and also installs apacheserver)
(last line of command runs apache at the foreground)
save and exit
Lets then create the image by running the command 
docker build --tag centos_apache:v2 .
this is telling docker to build the image called centos_apache:v2 in this directory we are in (.)
Final run is to run this command and expose the port on whatever port you want. for this i will forward my port from 80 to 9090
docker run -d -p 9090:80 --name Centosdocked centos_apache:v2 
(this means i told docker to run this image at the foreground (-d), using port 9090:80 (-p) and named my container centosdocked (--name) and the name of my Image




to check your running containers
docker ps
docker ps -a (all containers)
Docker images (list of images)
docker rm -f "containerid" (-f is to force it to remove incase its running)
